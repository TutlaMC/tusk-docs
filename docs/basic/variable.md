# Variables

- Variables are like boxes, they store things. You can read `set` in `effects` to see how to declare one.
- Variables can also have *properties*. You can declare/call a property by saying `IDENTIFIER's IDENTIFIER`
  - The first identifier is the name of the variable to which property you are going to set and the second on is the name of the property
  
- [variable name] is either a property (read the second point above) or a variable ( `IDENTIFIER` )
