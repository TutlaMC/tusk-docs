# Effects

Effects are what you want the language to do or effect. To read all the effects, read [this](reference/effects). Here are some example effects to get started (some may be outdated):

### print
```print [expression]```

This prints the expression to the console

### set
```set [variable name] to [expression]```

- Variable Name could be a variable or a property (read Variable)
- This sets the variable name to the expression to be used later on

### wait
```wait [expression]```

- Expression must be a number
- Waits [expression] seconds
