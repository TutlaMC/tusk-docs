# Welcome to TUSK Docs

This is the **official** documentation for Tusk. 

If you are a beginner then we recommend [installing](install.md) then [setting it up](setup.md) and learn from the basics with some example scripts. Do not go straight to making AI Chatbots, Bitcoin Miners or Minecraft Integrations- you'll have to learn APIs, Encoding and more for all of that. This was made to be simple so start with the basics and build a foundation if you do not know anything about coding. **Tusk is also a great way to start a programming career!**

**Are you an advanced developer who wants to add more?** [Read This](modding.md)
